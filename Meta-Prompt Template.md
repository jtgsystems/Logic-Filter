Meta-Prompt Template for NLP Tasks

Task Description: [Briefly describe the NLP task for which the prompt will be
used. Be specific about the desired outcome and target audience.]

Goals: [List the primary objectives of the prompt. What should the model achieve
by following this prompt? Examples: Generate creative text, summarize a
document, answer a question accurately.]

Constraints: [Specify any limitations or restrictions that the model should
adhere to. Examples: Length constraints, specific vocabulary, avoidance of
certain topics, required style or tone.]

Examples: [Provide one or more examples of ideal outputs. These examples should
demonstrate the desired style, format, and content. Vary the examples to cover
different scenarios or edge cases.]

Expected Outcomes: [Describe the anticipated results of using the prompt. How
will success be measured? What are the key performance indicators (KPIs)?]

Taxonomy of Prompting Strategies: [Detail the prompting strategies employed in
this template. Examples:

- Zero-shot prompting: Relying on the model's pre-existing knowledge without
  specific examples.
- Few-shot prompting: Providing a small number of examples to guide the model.
- Chain-of-thought prompting: Encouraging the model to explain its reasoning
  process step-by-step.
- Role-playing: Instructing the model to adopt a specific persona or role.
  Explain how these strategies are tailored to the specific NLP task.]

Model Capabilities: [Acknowledge the strengths and limitations of the target
language model. Consider factors such as:

- Model size and architecture
- Training data and biases
- Performance on similar tasks
- Known weaknesses or failure modes Explain how the prompt design leverages the
  model's strengths and mitigates its weaknesses.]

Evaluation Metrics: [Specify the metrics that will be used to evaluate the
quality of the generated prompts and the model's output. Examples:

- BLEU: Measuring the similarity between the generated text and a reference
  text.
- ROUGE: Evaluating the recall of important content in summarization tasks.
- Human judgment: Assessing the relevance, coherence, and fluency of the
  generated text. Describe how these metrics will be applied and interpreted.]

Customization Gradient: [Explain how the prompt can be customized to suit
different task complexities and requirements. Provide guidelines for:

- Adjusting the level of detail in the task description.
- Modifying the number and type of examples.
- Varying the constraints and restrictions.
- Adapting the prompting strategy.]

Optimization Techniques: [Describe the machine learning techniques used to
refine the prompt's length and complexity. Examples:

- Reinforcement learning: Training a model to optimize the prompt for a specific
  reward function.
- Genetic algorithms: Evolving prompts through mutation and crossover.
- Automated prompt engineering: Using algorithms to search for optimal prompt
  structures. Explain how these techniques enhance prompt efficiency without
  sacrificing clarity.]

Ambiguity Reduction: [Explain how controlled vocabularies or ontologies are used
to minimize ambiguity in the prompt. Examples:

- Using a predefined set of terms with clear definitions.
- Referencing a knowledge graph or semantic network.
- Employing disambiguation techniques to resolve word sense ambiguity. Describe
  how these measures ensure precision and relevance.]

Scoring Rubric: [Develop a scoring rubric for evaluating prompt quality based on
the following criteria:

- Effectiveness: Does the prompt achieve its intended goals?
- Efficiency: Is the prompt concise and easy to understand?
- Versatility: Can the prompt be adapted to different tasks and models? Provide
  specific guidelines for assigning scores based on these criteria.]

Iterative Refinement Process: [Establish an iterative process for continuous
improvement of the meta-prompt template. This process should include:

- A/B testing: Comparing different versions of the prompt to identify the most
  effective design.
- User feedback: Gathering input from users on the clarity, usability, and
  effectiveness of the prompt.
- Performance monitoring: Tracking the model's performance over time and
  identifying areas for improvement. Describe how this iterative process will
  ensure the ongoing optimization of the meta-prompt template.]

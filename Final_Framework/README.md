# AI Problem-Solving Framework: Consolidated Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive AI-driven problem-solving framework that integrates advanced artificial intelligence capabilities with structured methodologies to solve complex problems across domains. The framework has been consolidated from multiple source files to create a more organized, streamlined, and cohesive resource.

## Directory Structure

This consolidated repository contains the following key files:

- **Master_AI_Problem_Solving_Framework.md** - The primary document containing the complete framework architecture, methodologies, and implementation guidelines.

- **AI_Decision_Matrix.md** - Detailed decision matrices and evaluation criteria for AI-driven problem analysis and solution generation.

- **Technical_Implementation_Guide.md** - Technical specifications, code examples, and implementation instructions for the framework components.

- **Problem_Solving_Components.md** - Specialized methodologies including the Conveyor System approach, scheduling components, and assessment rubrics.

- **First_Principles_and_Advanced_Thinking.md** - Foundational approaches to problem decomposition and advanced thinking frameworks.

- **AI_Learning_and_Improvement.md** - Self-improvement methodologies for AI systems to continuously enhance problem-solving capabilities.

- **Bot_Implementation.py** - Python implementation of a problem-solving bot that uses LLMs to decompose problems, generate solutions, and learn from feedback.

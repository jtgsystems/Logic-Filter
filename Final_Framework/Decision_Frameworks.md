# Decision Frameworks

This document consolidates methodologies and matrices for adaptive and AI-driven problem-solving decisions.

## Adaptive Problem Solver Concept

The concept of an Adaptive Problem Solver emphasizes the ability to leverage various analytical thinking models and customize approaches based on the unique attributes of each challenge. This involves proficiency in techniques such as First Principles Thinking, Contrarian Thinking, The 5 Whys Technique, Thought Experiments, OODA Loop modeling, Socratic Questioning, Heuristic Analysis, and Dialectical Thinking. The goal is to offer nuanced, multi-dimensional insights by seamlessly integrating these diverse analytical skills.

```python
solver = Agent(
    role='Adaptive Problem Solver',
    goal='Provide expert guidance in complex problem-solving scenarios',
    backstory="""As the Adaptive Problem Solver, I have highly developed skills in a wide variety of analytical thinking models. Through years of training, I have gained mastery of techniques like First Principles Thinking, where I dissect complex issues down to their fundamental truths. I am also proficient in practices such as Contrarian Thinking, where I systematically explore opposing viewpoints to gain new perspectives. Some of my other specialized methodologies include The 5 Whys Technique for root cause analysis, Thought Experiments to hypothesize innovative solutions, OODA Loop modeling to rapidly iterate ideas, Socratic Questioning to uncover implicit assumptions, Heuristic Analysis to find patterns in data, and Dialectical Thinking to synthesize opposing theories. I have the ability to seamlessly integrate multiple models, and customize my approach based on the unique attributes of each challenge. My goal is to offer nuanced, multi-dimensional insights by leveraging the full range of my analytical skills. Please describe your issue - I am here to listen without judgment and apply all of my training to provide expert guidance.”,

## AI Problem-Solving Decision Matrix

This matrix outlines a structured approach to AI-driven problem-solving decisions across various phases.

### Core Principles
1.  Objective Alignment Protocol
2.  Ethical Constraint Boundaries
3.  Contextual Adaptation Framework
4.  Human Oversight Requirements
5.  Explainability Standards

### Phase 1: Problem Analysis
#### Input Evaluation Matrix
| Factor              | Weight | Assessment Criteria              |
| --------------------- | -------- | -----------------------------------|
| Urgency             | 20%    | Impact timeline < 72h = High     |
| Complexity          | 25%    | >3 subsystems involved = High    |
| Stakeholder Impact  | 30%    | Affects >1000 users = Critical   |
| Data Reliability    | 15%    | Source credibility score ≥ 0.8   |
| Historical Precedent| 10%    | Previous solution success rate   |

#### Context Mapping Protocol
1. Environmental Scan
2. Dependency Identification
3. Constraint Cataloging
4. Risk Horizon Analysis

### Phase 2: Solution Generation
#### Idea Validation Checklist
- [ ] Alignment with core objectives
- [ ] Compliance with ethical guidelines
